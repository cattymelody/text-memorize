You can also specify the number of attempts you want to allow with the `--a` flag. To turn off colors, just send in the `--no-color` flag.\r\n\r\ntext-memorize uses Python 2.7.\r\n\r\n### How to run\r\n\r\n`python text_memorize.py filename`\r\n\r\nFor between *i* and *j* words removed per line:\r\n\r\n`python text_memorize.py --l i --u j filename`\r\n\r\nFor exactly *k* words removed per line:\r\n\r\n`python text_memorize.py --n k filename`\r\n\r\nFor infinite attempts:\r\n\r\n`python text_memorize.py --a 0 filename`\r\n\r\nWithout color:\r\n\r\n`python text_memorize.py --no-color filename`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contribute\r\n\r\nContributions are welcome!
